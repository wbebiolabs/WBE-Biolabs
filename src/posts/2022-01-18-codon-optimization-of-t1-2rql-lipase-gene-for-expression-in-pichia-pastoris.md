### BACKGROUND

Codon optimization is performed to adapt the codon usage of a gene isolated from a foreign organism to the codon preference of the expression host organism. T1.2RQL is a lipase gene originated from G. stearothermophilus T.12. Therefore, codon usage adjustment needs to be performed for expression in a heterologous host such as Pichia pastoris. However, codon usage is not the only factor influencing gene expression. Various parameters should also be considered to obtain an optimum expression rate in the target host organism including transcription-, mRNA processing and stability-, translation-, and protein folding-related factors (see figure 1).
