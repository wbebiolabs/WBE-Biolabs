### BACKGROUND

T1.2 lipase, which originated from *Geobacillus stearothermophilus* T1.2 and exhibits esterase activity, was previously isolated, modified, and expressed in the lab. Various genetic engineering efforts were also made to improve the yield of lipase T1.2 production while maintaining its enzymatic activity. For example, switching the expression host from *Escherichia coli* to *Bacillus sp.* was demonstrated to improve lipase expression level. In this report, codon optimization was utilized to improve lipase T1.2 enzyme expression in *Bacillus subtilis* WB800. The complementary laboratory experiment results were reported by Esti Puspitasari. 

### OBJECTIVES

To design and synthesize the *Bacillus subtilis* codon-optimized T1.2RQL lipase gene to improve the expression level of lipase in *B. subtilis* host cells.
